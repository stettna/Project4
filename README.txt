==================================
-- Premise --
Our Final Project's main focus is on building a simple multiplayer game.
That is, a game that two players can connect to.
Both players( clients ) will be connecting to a server and sending relevant information 
to each other through the host server

-- Libraries \ Modules Used --
socket
thread
pygame?
tkinter?

-- Gameplay --
depends on what game we make!
options:
  - tic tac toe
  - chess
  - checkers
  - rock paper scissors
  - pong <- ?
regardless, each game will:
  - have a starting state
  - some states in between
  - and end state( one player wins and one player loses ) ( or draw depending )
